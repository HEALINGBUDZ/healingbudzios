                        liability, action, and cause of action are known or unknown, suspected or
                        unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed. If you are a California resident or

                        California Civil Code section 1542 in connection with the foregoing (or such
                        other similar applicable law in your state), which states: “a general
                        release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
                        suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release,
                        which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her
                        settlement with the debtor.”

                    <li>We are based in Miami, Florida, in the United States of America with
                        principal offices in Miami, Florida. The laws of the state of Florida,
                        excluding Florida’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes
                        arising out of or relating to these Terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>You acknowledge that if any dispute arising out of or relating to us, the
                        Terms, the Privacy Policy, or the Healing Budz Platform, the breach of any
                        term hereof, or any effort by any part to enforce, interpret and/or
                        construe, rescind, terminate, or annul the Terms or Privacy Policy, or any
                        provision thereof, including, without limitation, the applicability of this
                        arbitration provision, cannot be first settled through direct discussions,
                        the parties agree to exclusively resolve the controversy through binding
                        arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
                        American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules for
                        arbitration, although the arbitration shall not be administered by the AAA;
                        rather, said arbitration shall be conducted in Miami-Dade County, Florida,
                        before a single arbitrator who shall administer the Arbitration in all
                        respects. Any party hereto may initiate the arbitration process by sending a
                        written demand for arbitration, which shall generally state that party’s
                        claims and grounds thereof. The parties shall attempt to agree on an
                        arbitrator and the non-initiating party(ies) shall provide the names of at
                        least four potential arbitrators to the party that initiated the arbitration
                        proceedings within twenty (20) days of receipt of the demand for
                        arbitration; if the initiating party does not select one of the four
                        arbitrators proposed within twenty (20) days, the initiating party may elect
                        for both parties to select attorneys within ten (10) days of receipt of the
                        demand for arbitration, at the initiating party’s expense, and those two
                        attorneys shall select the arbitrator within 10 days. If a party fails to
                        respond to a written demand for arbitration, or to submit names of
                        acceptable arbitrators within twenty (20) days of receipt of demand for
                        arbitration, or fails to hire an attorney to select the arbitrator within
                        forty (40) days of receipt of demand for arbitration, then the AAA shall
                        appoint a neutral arbitrator and the party that initiated arbitration may
                        proceed and the non-responsive party(ies) agree to be bound by said
                        arbitrator’s decision. No depositions shall occur in the arbitration without
                        the consent of either the other party or the arbitrator. To the fullest
                        extent permitted, all aspects of the mediation and arbitration, including
                        but not limited to any settlement and/or decision, shall be deemed
                        confidential.

                        state courts of Miami-Dade County, Florida, you and we consent to personal
                        jurisdiction in those courts. FURTHERMORE, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY JURY

                        contained within these Terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any

                    <li>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
                        constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.
                    </li>
                    <li>Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party

                        other remedies under these Terms. If for any reason an arbitrator as set
                        forth herein or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
                        these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
                        maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will
                        remain in full force and effect.
